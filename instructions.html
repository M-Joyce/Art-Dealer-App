			<p> The Art Dealer is a game in which you, the player, attempt to present cards to
			the art dealer (the computer) in the hopes that the art dealer accepts all four of
			the presented cards. If the art dealer accepts all four cards, you win! Otherwise,
			the art dealer will identify which of the cards he is willing to buy, and you will
			get another chance to offer the art dealer four cards. </p>

			<!-- I'll update this once the actual game is finished, this is more of an example of
				 step by step instructions. -->
