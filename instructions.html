			<p> The Art Dealer is a game in which you, the player, attempt to present cards to
			the art dealer (the computer) in the hopes that the art dealer accepts all four of
			the presented cards. If the art dealer accepts all four cards, you win! Otherwise,
			the art dealer will identify which of the cards he is willing to buy, and you will
			get another chance to offer the art dealer four cards. </p>

			
			<div class="stepByStep">
				<h3>Step by step:</h3>

				<p>First, start by selecting the cards you wish to offer by clicking on them.</p>

				<p>Next, click on the Submit button to offer the cards to the art dealer.</p>

				<img src="pictures/submit.png" />

				<p>The art dealer will select which cards it wants to buy, and indicate that back.</p>

				<p>Afterwards, you can click on the individual cards to remove them one by one,</p>

				<img src="pictures/removeCard.png" />

				<p> or press the clear button to remove all four cards at once.</p>

				<img src="pictures/clear.png" />

				<p>If you guess the correct cards each round, you will get a "win" dialog, if not, you will get a "lose" dialog. Either way you will be directed next to the "Game Over Page". Once here just click the button go to the start.</p>
